Homework Lesson 1 - Debug this code.

This script was written to allow you to draw simple squares of various sizes, 
but the code is full of errors. Find and correct the errors so that the code
runs as demonstrated in class. 

A few of notes:

1. DO NOT make any changes above line 20. The code above line 20 is correct.
2. Two lines (34 & 35 - the 'for' loop) are correct and should not be changed (see comments in code).
3. You should not ADD any lines of code; you should not DELETE any lines of code
4. Once you have completed your edits, save the script as yourname_squares.py and upload using Sakai.
5. Be sure to upload your file even if you haven't completely debugged it; you will get credit for each correct change you make.
